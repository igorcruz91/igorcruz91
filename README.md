### Hi there, I'm Igor !

I am a Bachelor in Physics and a Master in Quantum Computing, both from the University of SÃ£o Paulo - USP.

Passionate about analyzing and working with data, I am always motivated to learn, share knowledge, and, above all, apply my skills to projects and solutions. I enjoy working with Machine Learning, AI, and Quantum Computing applications, alongside innovative teams that aim to develop great ideas and solutions for real-world projects and problems.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at Proffer, on projects involving Machine Learning, AI, LLMs, and AWS.

### What I'm focusing on

Currently improving my ML, AI and SQL skills, as well as learning AWS and Azure.
